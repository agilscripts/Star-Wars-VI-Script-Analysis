# Star Wars VI Script Analysis

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook contains a comprehensive analysis of the script from *Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi*. The analysis explores various aspects of the script, including word frequency, character dialogue distribution, sentiment analysis, and character interactions. The aim is to gain deeper insights into the narrative, character development, and thematic elements of the movie.

## Features

The notebook includes the following analyses:

1. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Identifies the most frequently used words throughout the script, excluding common words (stop words) and character names.
   
2. **Character Dialogue Analysis**: Counts the number of lines spoken by each character to determine their prominence in the script.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Assesses the emotional tone of each character’s dialogue using sentiment polarity scores.

4. **Character Interaction Analysis**: Examines the frequency of interactions between characters to understand relationships and dynamics.

5. **Word Cloud Visualizations**: Generates word clouds for each character, providing a visual representation of their most frequently used words.

6. **Dialogue Length Analysis**: Calculates the average length of dialogues spoken by each character, offering insights into their speaking style.

7. **Conversation Network Graph**: Visualizes character interactions as a network graph, where nodes represent characters and edges represent the number of dialogue exchanges.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you'll need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `nltk`
- `TextBlob`
- `networkx`
- `wordcloud`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk textblob networkx wordcloud
```

### Installing LaTeX for PDF Export

If you want to export the notebook to PDF format, ensure you have `xelatex` installed. For macOS users, you can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask mactex
```

### Running the Notebook

1. **Download the Jupyter Notebook**: Make sure you have the notebook file (`StarWarsVI_Script_Analysis.ipynb`) on your local machine.
   
2. **Open the Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook in your terminal or Anaconda Navigator, and open the `StarWarsVI_Script_Analysis.ipynb` file.

3. **Run All Cells**: Execute all the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis and generate the visualizations. You can do this by clicking on `Cell > Run All` in the Jupyter Notebook menu.

## Files Included

- **StarWarsVI_Script_Analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for the analysis.
- **SW_EpisodeVI.txt**: The text file containing the script of *Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi*.

## Results

The results of the analysis are displayed in the notebook as graphs, tables, and visualizations. Key findings include:

- Han Solo has the most dialogue lines, reflecting his central role.
- The sentiment analysis shows that some characters, like Luke, have more positive dialogue, while others, like the Emperor, have a more negative tone.
- Word clouds reveal unique vocabularies for each character, highlighting their distinctive speech patterns.
